# Download and Install LibriSpeech Datasets and Generate Metadata File

Follow the steps below in order to fully download and install LibriSpeech and create a custom metadata file that will be used as a custom method for pre-training. 

*** You must run both scripts before you start pretraining Wav2Vec2.0 from scratch ***

## Download LibriSpeech

In order to download LibriSpeech from OpenSLR.org, you can simply run the 'download_librispeech.py' script in the 'generate_audio_mappings' directory. 

The script takes two arguments when compiling:

    python3 download_librispeech.py --data_dir_name DATA_DIR_NAME --split SPLIT
    
    # example
    python3 download_librispeech.py --data_dir_name Data --split train-clean-100
    
1. --data_dir_name: The name of the folder in which to download LibriSpeech. EX: '--data_dir_name Data' will create a directory called Data and download all the files in there
2. --split: The split of LibriSpeech you would like to download. The available splits are 'dev', 'train-clean-100', 'train-clean-360', and 'test'. It is recommened to initially download 'train-clean-100' first, which is 100 hours of LibriSpeech cleaned audio. 


## Generate CSV File with Audio Metadata and Mappings to Audio Files

The training file only works when reading metadata about the audio files from a CSV file. In order to create this CSV file, simply run the 'generate_audio_paths_excel.py' script in the 'generate_audio_mappings' directory with the following arguments:

    python3 generate_audio_paths_excel.py --path /path/to/data/dir --csv_name CSV_NAME
    
    # example
    python3 generate_audio_paths_excel.py --path /home/ubuntu/project/Data/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100 --csv_name librispeech_train_100.csv
    
1. --path: Provide the full path to the data directory where the data is stored. EX: '--path /home/ubuntu/project/Data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean'
2. --csv_name: Provide any name you would like the CSV file to be named. It is recommended you name the CSV file based on whichever split you download from the previous step with the '.csv' extension at the end. EX: if you download 'train-clean-100', name your file something like 'librispeech_train_100.csv'

After running the script, the CSV file will be saved in the same directory as the 'generate_audio_paths_excel.py'

## Start Pre-Training Wav2Vec2.0 from Scratch

Now that you have successfully downloaded and installed LibriSpeech and created the metadata file, you can head over to the 'pretraining_wav2vec' directory to start pretraining the Wav2Vec2.0 on LibriSpeech.
